## General notes
- Keep on asking for help: there are mentors coaches, crew and other Hackers who can help
- Aim to lock down the concept by midday Saturday
- Mentor and coaches are available on site and via Slack
- Mentors have loads of ideas and problems they want solved
- On average it takes about an hour to load videos on YouTube. Factor this into the plan.
- Check the Eligibility criteria on each award category - some award require you to use data from a specific data portal or dataset
- Don't try to develop concepts that win every award, focus on complementary award categories
